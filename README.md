# To-Do
This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript together, I am currently in a bootcamp learning to code for the first time, but felt like I needed to start
making my own projects to really apply and understand what I am learning. I really hope to learn a lot with this project aand progress further into making programming a
career. I know to-do lists are a cliche first project, but I've got to start somewhere.
